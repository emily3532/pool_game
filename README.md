# To PLAY:
1. Click on white cue ball and drag, this will create a "cuestick".
[ Note: the further you drag from the ball, the more power you are giving to the cue ball, its quite sensitive so don't drag too far!]
2. Release your mouse and watch the balls move
3. Wait until ALL balls have stopped moving before reclicking the white cue and repeat steps 1-2.
4. Try get all the coloured balls into the pockets without the white ball falling in, the red balls will disappear and the blue balls will respawn ONCE, if there aren't any balls in proximity to their respawn spot.
5. The screen will show Win and Bye if won, you can then close the window OR if you lose, the game will continue to restart until you win.

Good Luck :)
